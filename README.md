## Project status
Our project is currently functional, allowing users to select travel packages and book them based on the number of rooms and number of persons. However, we need to improve the connectivity for fetching data in real-time. Additional enhancements such as integrating a more robust recommendation system and optimizing the user interface for better user experience are also planned.
